Whatever it is, it is what starts the design process as you start to work through what exactly the idea is, and what meaning it can have for people.  I find the idea stage both captivating and terrifying.  At this point everything can either seem like the best or worst idea.",

      title: "User Research",
      text: "Before you can start to design you need research to better understand whomever is going to see or use what you design.  Not just what people think they want, but also how they currently use that they have, and what works and doesn't work for them.  It's about listening to the stories and hearing what people really do in their day to day lives.  If your design doesn't fit into that, it won't succeed.  The outcome of this should be a firm definition of the problem you are solving, and a whole lot of good ideas on how that might be done.  My background is in business analysis and the first rule is that requirements are key--if you don't define what you're building, then what are you actually building?  A good problem definition will keep the design on track.",

      text: "There are several next-steps that can happen once the problem is understood, but one of the best to jump into is to start sketching away.  It's fast and easy to do, and it immediately starts getting ideas out of your head.  Don't hold on too tightly to any one idea at this point, just get as many as you can down on paper.  As you can see, actual drawing ability can help but is not required.  The best way to overcome creative paralysis is just to do, do, do.  If you make 100 sketches and throw 90% of them out, you still have 10 good ideas to work with.",

      text: "Along with brainstorming in sketch form, it's also good to start to start laying out your ideas for how you expect a person to interact with your site.  I'm one of probably a very few people that finds great joy in definining a good user flow.  While the end result may look dull, it has a crucial part to play.  At this stage there are no final designs or code written.  Reworking a user flow diagram will take ten minutes, reworking an actual user flow on a site could take months.  This will also start the process of defining what screens and assets you will need to create.  No use building something if it's not needed.",

  text: "The user flow, site map, and data map triptych may come across as deadly dull for many people but I find they all work hand in hand and ensure that when you finally start making fun and colourful designs you are making the right things that will fit together in the right way.  With data mapping the focus is on what is needed where and in what format.  Similar to how the site map and user flows define which screens will be needed, the data map defines what data will be needed to be stored, retrieved, or requested.  No one wants to provide data that isn't needed to a website, and no one wants to have to go back after the fact and ask for more data if something was forgotten.",

These days there are lots of tools to do user testing quickly online and get near instant feedback on how well all your work up to this point actually works.  Much like user research, there is an art to asking the right question and making sure that you aren't either leading your testers by the hand too much, or else confusing them with poorly crafted tests.  If all goes well, however, you will end up with data that will either prove out your designs, or give important input into changes you can make before you launch.",

Hopefully the bulk of the larger changes have now been committed and so the development team can start building the Idea.",
